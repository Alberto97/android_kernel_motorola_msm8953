Intersil leds-isl98611 LEDs driver is used for controlling LEDs connected
to ISL98611 integrated display power and LED backlight driver.
The IC is connected to Host processor via i2C bus.

Required properties:
- compatible		: string should be "intersil,leds-isl98611"
- reg			: interger should be I2C address of the device
- linux,name		: name of the led that is used in led framework

Integer Register values will be written to the corresponding offsets of the IC after
applicable masking. Please refer to the ISL98611 manual for the interpretation.

Optional properties for backlight led:
- linux,default-trigger		: string trigger the led from external modules such as display
- intersil,default-on		: boolean default on for the led
- intersil,init-level		: integer default level applied if default-on is true
- intersil,no-reset		: boolean do not issue SW reset for IC during driver probe
- intersil,cabc-disable		: boolean do not use CABC inputs. PON vlaue is ON.
- intersil,hbm-on		: boolean enable high brightness mode (HBM) support.
- intersil,led-current		: integer current level for led current register  @ 0x12
- intersil,current-scale	: integer current level for led current multiplier register  @ 0x12
- intersil,hbm-led-current	: integer high brightness mode current level for led current register  @ 0x12
- intersil,hbm-current-scale	: integer high brightness mode current level for led current multiplier register  @ 0x12
- intersil,pwm-res		: integer pwm resolution for pwm res register @ 0x14
- intersil,dimm-threshold	: integer dimming threshold for dimming control register @ 0x13
- intersil,switch-supply	: name of the regulator to aquire and enable
- intersil,pfm-value		: register 0x15 setting for PFM entry threshold

Optional properties for display power control settings:
- intersil,vn		: negative supply voltage calculated as VN = -4.5V - vn*50mV
- intersil,vp		: positive supply voltage calculated as VP = 4.5V + vp*50mV

Example:

isl98611@29 {
	compatible = "intersil,leds-isl98611";
	reg = <0x29>;
	status = "okay";
	linux,name = "wled:backlight";
	linux,default-trigger = "bkl-trigger";
	intersil,default-on;
	intersil,vn = <20>;
	intersil,vp = <20>;
};
