Mstar series touch controller implementation

Required properties:

 - compatible		: Should be "mstar,msg2856a", compatible with the of_match_table defined in driver.
 - reg			: I2C slave address of the device.
 - interrupt-parent	: Parent of interrupt.
 - interrupts		: Configuration of touch panel controller interrupt
				GPIO.
 - touch,irq-gpio	: Interrupt gpio which is to provide interrupts to
				host, same as "interrupts" node.
 - touch,rst-gpio	: Reset gpio to control the reset of chip.

Optional properties:

 - vdd-supply		: Power supply needed to power up the device, when use
				external regulator, do not add this property.
 - vcc_i2c-supply	: Power source required to power up i2c bus.
				Mstar series can provide 1.8V from internal
				LDO, add this properties base on hardware
				design.

Optional properties inside config_modifier-modname child node:
 - enable-notification		: modifier has a switch notifier
 - patch-data			: modifier specific touch IC registers values
 - touch-clip-area		: modifier specific touch events clipping

Example:
&i2c_3 {
	status = "ok";
	/* clock-frequency = <400000>; */
		msg2856a@26 {
			compatible = "mstar,msg2856a";
			reg = <0x26>;
			vdd-supply = <&pm8917_l10>;
			vcc_i2c-supply = <&pm8917_l5>;
			touch,reset-gpio = <&tlmm 64 0x00>;
			touch,irq-gpio = <&tlmm 65 0x00>;
		};
};
