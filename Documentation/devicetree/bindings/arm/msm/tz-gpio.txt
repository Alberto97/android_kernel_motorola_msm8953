* TZGPIO (Trust Zone GPIO)

The /sys/private/ is a sysfs interface added for showing and changing
gpio's configuration. It's usefual to debug bottom-rock current by
comparing and setting gpio's configuration before suspend. Because TZ
has restricted some gpios' accessing from AP, linux kernel will crash
if these gpios are accessed in AP. The gpio list here is used for AP
not to access them and avoid linux kernel's crash.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "qcom,tz-gpio"
- tlmm-tz    : List of GPIOs protected by TZ

Example:

	qcom, tz_gpio {
		compatible = "qcom,tz_gpio";
		tlmm-tz = <111>,
			<126>;
	};
