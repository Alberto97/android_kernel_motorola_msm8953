* NXP NFC PN544, PN650 Controller

The NXP NFC family of products are connected to the host processor via i2c for
commands and have various GPIOs connected to control reset, irq, and firmware
downloading.

Required properties:
 - compatible:
        one of the following strings "nxp,pn544", or "nxp,pn65O"
 - reg:
        the i2c slave address of the IC
 - interrupts:
        there is one interrupt line connected to the main SoC
 - interrupt-parent:
        The parent interrupt controller
 - gpios:
        an array specifying the three required GPIOs for operation. They must
        be specified in exact order:
           - IRQ GPIO
           - VEN GPIO - the enable/reset line to the IC
           - Firmware GPIO - GPIO used to toggle the initiation of a firmware
             download.

Optional properties:
 - nxp,pnxxx-discharge-delay:
        the minimum time (in milliseconds) for which we need to hold the VEN
        gpio in the reset/disabled state.  If this is not specified, the
        default value of 10ms is used
 - nxp,pnxxx-ven-inv-polarity:
        this indicates that the VEN GPIO has an inverse polarity. If set to 0
        or not defined, the chip will be enabled when VEN GPIO is logic level 1
        and disabled when logic level 0.  If this is set to 1, it indicates an
        active low configuration: VEN GPIO is enabled when logical level 0.
             0 - active high for enable
             1 - active low for enable
 - vdd-supply:
	this is for the power supply for nfc chip.
Example:

	i2c@1a200000 {
		status = "okay";

		qcom,i2c-bus-freq = <400000>;
		qcom,i2c-src-freq = <24000000>;

		pnxxx@28 {
			compatible = "nxp,pn544";
			reg = <0x28>;
			interrupt-parent = <&msmgpio>;
			interrupts = <106 0>;
			gpios = <&msmgpio 106 0>,     /* IRQ */
				<&pm8921_gpio 33 0>,  /* VEN */
				<&pm8921_gpio 16 0>;  /* Firmware */

			nxp,pnxxx-discharge-delay = <2000>;
			nxp,pnxxx-ven-inv-polarity = <0>;
			vdd-supply = <&pm8226_l22>;
		};
	};
